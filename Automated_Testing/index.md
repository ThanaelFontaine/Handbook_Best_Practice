## Introduction
Task estimation is an important process in Scrum that helps the team understand the effort required to complete a specific task. We have identified 5 quality resources related to this topic, which we have analyzed to identify common themes. The following guidelines summarize the best practices for task estimation in Scrum:

### 1. Break tasks down into smaller, more manageable pieces to accurately estimate effort required.
   One of the most common challenges faced by project managers is estimating the effort required for a given task. Often, tasks are too complex or too vague to be accurately estimated without breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. In this blog post, we will discuss the importance of task decomposition and some tips on how to do it effectively.
   
   Breaking down tasks has several advantages for project management. Firstly, it helps to clarify the scope and requirements of the task, which can avoid misunderstandings and conflicts later on. Secondly, it allows for more realistic and accurate estimates of the time, resources and skills required to complete the task. Third, it facilitates the distribution and coordination of work among team members, as well as the monitoring and communication of progress and problems. Fourth, it reduces the risk of delays and errors due to unforeseen complications or dependencies.
   How do you break down tasks into smaller pieces? There are different methods and tools that can help us in this process, such as work breakdown structures (WBS), mind maps, flow charts or checklists. The key is to start with the main objective or deliverable of the task and then identify the subtasks or steps needed to achieve it. Each sub-task should be as specific and measurable as possible, and have a clear leader and deadline. The level of detail and granularity of subtasks can vary depending on the complexity and uncertainty of the task, but they should be small enough to be easily estimated and managed.
   Breaking down tasks into smaller pieces is not only good practice for project management, but also for personal productivity and motivation. It can help us overcome procrastination, focus on what matters most, celebrate small victories and achieve our goals more quickly and efficiently.

### 2. Use Planning Poker or similar techniques to facilitate group discussion and decision-making.
   One of the key principles of SCRUM is to allow the team to self-organise and collaborate effectively. However, this does not mean that the team can work without any structure or direction. In fact, the team must have a clear and shared understanding of the project's objectives, scope, requirements and priorities. This is where planning poker or similar techniques can be useful.
Planning poker is a technique that involves the whole team in estimating the effort and complexity of each user story or backlog task. Team members use a pack of cards with numbers that represent different levels of effort, such as the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.). Each team member chooses a card corresponding to his or her own estimate and reveals it simultaneously to the others. If there is a significant difference between the estimates, the team discusses the reasons and tries to reach a consensus. The process is repeated until the team agrees on a reasonable estimate for each element.
    The benefits of planning poker or similar techniques are many. Firstly, it encourages the team to have a constructive and respectful dialogue about the work to be done. It also uncovers hidden assumptions, dependencies, risks and uncertainties that may affect the project. Secondly, it fosters a sense of ownership and commitment among team members. By participating in the estimation process, team members feel more involved and accountable for the results of the project. Thirdly, it improves the accuracy and reliability of the estimates. By using a relative effort scale rather than absolute hours or days, the team can avoid over- or underestimating the work. In addition, by drawing on the collective wisdom and experience of the team, estimates are more likely to reflect the reality of the project.
    In conclusion, planning poker or similar techniques are valuable tools for facilitating group discussion and decision making in SCRUM. They help to create a common understanding and alignment between team members and to produce realistic and reliable estimates for items in the order book. By using these techniques regularly and consistently, the team can improve performance and deliver value to customers.
### 3. Consider the impact of dependencies and potential risks when estimating tasks.
   One of the key principles of SCRUM is to deliver value to the customer in short, frequent iterations. To achieve this, the team needs to estimate the tasks that make up each iteration, or sprint, and commit to completing them within the given timeframe. However, estimating tasks is not simply a matter of assigning hours or points to each activity. It also involves considering the impact of dependencies and potential risks that may affect task completion.
   Dependencies are the relationships between tasks that determine the order in which they can be performed. For example, a task may depend on the completion of another task first, the availability of a resource or the provision of an external input. Dependencies can create bottlenecks, delays and conflicts in the workflow and reduce the flexibility and responsiveness of the team. Therefore, when estimating tasks, the team should identify and document dependencies and plan how to manage them effectively. Potential risks are uncertain events or conditions that may have a negative impact on the completion of the task. For example, a risk may be a technical problem, a change in requirements, staff turnover or feedback from the customer. Risks can lead to rework, changes in project scope, quality problems and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, when estimating tasks, the team should assess and prioritise risks and plan how to mitigate or avoid them.
   By considering the impact of dependencies and potential risks when estimating tasks, the team can improve the accuracy and reliability of its estimates and increase its chances of delivering value to the customer in each sprint.

### 4. Review and revise task estimates regularly, particularly when new information becomes available.
   One of the key principles of SCRUM is to deliver value to the customer in short iterations called sprints. To do this effectively, the team must have a realistic and accurate plan of what they can accomplish in each sprint. This is where task estimation comes in. Task estimation involves assigning a numerical value to each task in the backlog, which represents the effort required to complete it. Task estimation helps the team prioritize the most important and useful tasks, allocate resources efficiently and monitor progress and performance.
   However, task assessment is not a one-off activity that can be done once and forgotten. It is a dynamic and continuous process that requires constant review and revision. Why is this so important? Because things change. New information becomes available, new requirements emerge, new dependencies are discovered, new risks are identified, new technologies are introduced, and so on. All these factors can affect the initial estimates and make them obsolete or inaccurate.
   Therefore, the team should regularly review and revise its task estimates, especially when new information becomes available. This can happen at various points in the SCRUM process, such as during sprint planning, daily meetings, sprint reviews or sprint retrospectives. The team should use empirical data and feedback from previous sprints to adjust their estimates based on their actual performance and learning. The team should also communicate any changes to its estimates to the product owner and other stakeholders so that they can align their expectations and priorities accordingly.
   Regularly reviewing and revising task estimates is not only a good practice, it is also a necessity in SCRUM. It helps the team deliver value to the customer faster and better, while avoiding waste, frustration and disappointment. It also allows the team to improve their estimation skills and accuracy over time, which builds confidence among team members and the customer.

### 5. Identify and mitigate potential blockers or obstacles that may impact task completion.
   One of the key principles of SCRUM is to deliver value to the customer in short and frequent iterations. To achieve this, the SCRUM team must plan, execute and review its work in a collaborative and transparent manner. However, the team may sometimes encounter challenges or difficulties that prevent them from completing their tasks on time. These obstacles can have a negative impact on the productivity, quality and morale of the team.
   Blockers or obstacles can be internal or external to the team. Internal blockers are those that arise from the team's own processes, skills, tools or dependencies. For example, a team member may not have the knowledge or experience to complete a task, or a tool may malfunction or become unavailable. External barriers are those that are beyond the team's control, such as changing customer requirements, stakeholder interference, regulatory issues or environmental factors.
   The SCRUM team should identify and mitigate potential blockers or obstacles as early as possible, before they become critical or escalate. This can be done through a variety of techniques and practices, such as
- Daily meetings: Team members share their progress, plans and obstacles every day. This helps to highlight problems or risks that may affect the team's work and to coordinate actions to resolve them.
- Defining what is done: The team agrees on a set of criteria that define when a task is completed and meets quality standards. This avoids ambiguity, rework and technical debt.
- Sprint backlog refinement: The team regularly reviews and updates the sprint backlog to ensure that tasks are clear, achievable and consistent with the sprint goal. This prevents confusion, scope creep and unrealistic expectations.
- Sprint retrospective: The team reflects on its performance and results at the end of each sprint and identifies what went well and what can be improved. This allows them to learn from the experience and implement changes for future sprints.
By identifying and mitigating potential blockages or obstacles, the SCRUM team can increase its effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. It can also deliver value to the customer faster and more reliably.
