# AUTOMATED TESTING

## Introduction

Code reviews are an important part of ensuring code quality and catching potential issues before they make it into production. We have analyzed 5 quality resources related to this topic to identify common themes. The following guidelines summarize the best practices for code reviews:

The following guidelines summarize the best practices for task estimation in Scrum:

- Break tasks down into smaller, more manageable pieces to accurately estimate effort required.
- Use Planning Poker or similar techniques to facilitate group discussion and decision-making.
- Consider the impact of dependencies and potential risks when estimating tasks.
- Review and revise task estimates regularly, particularly when new information becomes available.
- Identify and mitigate potential blockers or obstacles that may impact task completion.

### Review code regularly and frequently to catch issues early and provide timely feedback.

Review code regularly and frequently to catch problems early and provide timely feedback" is a key principle of effective code review, as outlined in Google's Code Review Guidelines. Code review is an essential part of the software development process, where team members evaluate each other's code to identify potential problems and ensure that the code meets established coding standards. Regular and frequent code reviews can help detect problems early in the development cycle, which can save considerable time and effort in the long run. In addition, timely feedback can be provided to developers, which can help them correct problems while the code is still fresh in their minds. By reviewing code regularly and frequently, teams can identify and resolve issues more effectively, leading to higher quality code and a more streamlined development process.

Of course, here are some additional tips and best practices for code review:

* Set clear expectations: it is important to set clear expectations for the code review, including the coding standards to be met, the level of detail required, and the timeframe for the review. This helps to ensure that the code review is effective and consistent.
* Involve the right stakeholders: Involve the team members who are most knowledgeable in the relevant area for the code review. Senior developers can provide a valuable perspective and help detect more subtle problems.
* Provide constructive feedback: feedback should be constructive and helpful, rather than simply pointing out errors. Suggestions for improving the code can also be provided.

### Establish clear guidelines and standards for code formatting, documentation, and style.

"Establishing clear guidelines and standards for code formatting, documentation and style is essential to ensure consistent and easily understood code for the whole team. Coding standards should be consistent and easily understood by all team members. This minimises coding errors and makes it easier to maintain the code in the long term. It is also important to focus on documentation to help team members understand the code and facilitate collaboration. SmartBear's "10 Best Practices for Peer Code Review" recommends ensuring that comments are clear and concise, using consistent naming conventions and providing code examples. Additional best practices include checking code using static analysis tools to detect code quality issues, ensuring security rules are followed, sharing knowledge among team members, and making sure code review is done regularly."

* Consult the coding conventions of the platform: Popular programming languages often have specific coding conventions for formatting and styling code. It is important to consult these to ensure that coding standards conform to recommended practices.
* Establish standards for comments: Comments should be clear, concise and consistent. It is important to set standards for comments, for example specifying their location, length, tone, style and content.
* Establish standards for documentation: Code documentation should be clear, concise and easily understood. It is important to establish standards for documentation, such as the types of information to be included, their location and format.
* Involve team members: Team members should be involved in setting coding standards. This helps to ensure that the standards are consistent with recommended practices and that all team members understand the expectations.

### Encourage peer review and collaboration to promote learning and knowledge sharing.

Encouraging peer review and collaboration is essential to promote learning and knowledge sharing within the development team. Peer review allows team members to share expertise, discover alternative solutions and learn new practices and techniques. By encouraging collaboration, team members can work together to solve problems, share ideas and improve the quality of the code. Atlassian's Code Review Best Practices recommends ensuring that peer reviews are conducted regularly and consistently, using code review tools to facilitate the process. It is also important to provide constructive feedback, focusing on issues rather than people, and to promote a positive and collaborative working environment. Additional good practices include fostering diversity and inclusion by encouraging the participation of all team members, creating mentoring and training opportunities to foster continuous learning, and promoting transparency by sharing the results of the peer review with the entire team.

### Use tools and automation to support the review process and identify potential issues.

The use of tools and automation can help facilitate the code review process and quickly identify potential problems. Tools such as code checkers, linters and security analysis tools can help identify syntax errors, coding standards violations, security vulnerabilities and other potential problems. These tools can be configured to easily integrate into existing development workflows, automating part of the review process and helping to save time and effort. In addition, the use of version management tools such as Git can help facilitate collaboration between team members and provide visibility into changes made to code.

SmartBear's "10 Best Practices for Peer Code Review" article also recommends using code review tools to help manage review processes, track comments and ensure consistency. It is important to select the right tools based on the needs of the team and to ensure that they are used effectively and consistently by all team members. In addition, it is important to ensure that automation does not completely replace human review, but rather complements and supports it.

Finally, Atlassian's Code Review Best Practices article highlights the importance of using tools to help reduce bias and promote inclusion in the review process. For example, code suggestion tools can help reduce bias by suggesting code changes based on coding standards rather than personal preferences.

In sum, the use of tools and automation can help support the code review process and quickly identify potential problems. However, it is important to select the right tools for the team's needs, ensure they are used effectively and consistently, and not completely replace human review with automation."

### Provide constructive feedback that is specific, actionable, and respectful.

When providing feedback on code, it is important to do so in a constructive, specific and respectful manner. Feedback should be based on coding standards and project requirements, rather than personal preferences, and should offer concrete suggestions rather than mere criticism. Providing balanced feedback and identifying the positive aspects of the code can encourage developers and help them continue to learn.

Atlassian's Code Review Best Practices article highlights the importance of a collaborative approach when providing feedback, encouraging developers to discuss their feedback with their peers. It is also crucial to keep in mind the context and goals of the project when providing feedback so that it is useful and relevant.

SmartBear's "10 Best Practices for Peer Code Review" guide recommends providing feedback in a timely manner to allow developers to make changes as soon as possible. They also stress the importance of providing specific and actionable feedback, which includes concrete suggestions for improving the code.

Finally, Google's Code Review Guidelines emphasise the importance of providing feedback in a respectful working environment, avoiding negative feedback that may be perceived as offensive or discouraging. It is crucial to be clear and precise in your feedback to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

In short, providing constructive feedback is crucial to help developers improve their code and continue to learn. Feedback should be based on coding standards and project requirements, rather than personal preferences, and should offer concrete suggestions. Feedback should also be provided in a respectful working environment, be balanced and include positive feedback. Taking a collaborative approach and providing timely feedback can help developers improve their work and achieve their goals.
