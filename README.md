# Handbook_Best_Practice

The purpose of this handbook is to provide guidelines for software quality best practices within our small, fast-moving startup. With 20 software engineers working independently, there has been unpredictable progress with projects and many defects making it into production. This handbook will serve as a resource for existing and new team members to learn the "right way" of doing things in our company. The handbook will cover the following topics: Task estimation in Scrum, Code reviews, and a third topic of our choosing based on our research.
