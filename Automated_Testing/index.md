# AUTOMATED TESTING

## Introduction
Automated testing is the third topic we have chosen to cover in this handbook. We have identified 5 quality resources related to this topic and identified common themes among them. The following guidelines summarize the best practices for automated testing:

### 1. Write tests early and often to ensure coverage and catch issues early in the development process.
   Writing tests is a key feature in IT development, as a matter of fact there is a development methodology that is called TDD (Test Driven Development) that advocates creating tests before even coding so you are sure that your code is going to fulfill its purpose. But for some projects it is not possible to use TDD so instead of creating tests before coding we recommend creating them at the earliest stage possible to ensure that there is no useless function or any issues in any functions. 

### 2. Use a variety of testing types, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   As you probably know there are a lot of different kinds of tests that have a purpose for example unit tests are good for single functions to tests that the output is the one expected etc. We recommend that you use different kinds of tests to ensure that your code has good coverage and also that every issue is covered because you might see issues with unit coverage that you wonâ€™t detect with end to end testing or the other way around. We also recommend that you make scenarios that simulate the action of a person using your applications if it is one. With scenarios you might be able to see a different behavior in your code that can help you find bugs before you push.
   
### 3. Use tools and frameworks to support testing, such as Selenium for web applications or Appium for mobile applications.

### 4. Continuously monitor and evaluate test results to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.

### 5. Integrate testing into the development process as a standard practice, rather than as an afterthought.
